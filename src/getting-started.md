# Getting Started

This section will help you build a basic VitePress documentation site from ground up. If you already have an existing project and would like to keep documentation inside the project, start from Step 2.

::: warning
VitePress is currently in `alpha` status. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box documentation use, but the config and theming API may still change between minor releases.

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install @my-awesome/components
```

##### Usage

```bash
import { ResizableContainer } from '@vite-styleguidist/components'

<ResizableContainer sides="right"> Hello World! </ResizableContainer>
```
